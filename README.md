# Facial Recognition App

[!info] **Project Overview**:  
Welcome to my Facial Recognition app! This project is all about identifying faces from custom images and live video streams. Users will be able to upload their own images for recognition or use live video input for real-time detection. It's designed to be user-friendly and interactive with a beautiful web interface.

[!warning] **Current Status**:  
Please note, this app is still in development. While the basic functionality is in place, there are some ongoing improvements, especially around performance and accuracy. Keep an eye on updates!

[!important] **Upcoming Link**:  
Once it's fully ready, I'll be publishing the link for you to try it out. Stay tuned for the final release!
